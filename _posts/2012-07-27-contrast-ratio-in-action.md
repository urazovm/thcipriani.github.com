title: Website Contrast Ratio in Practice
---
While perusing [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/ "Hacker News") I ran across a single-page site called 
[Contrast Rebellion](http://contrastrebellion.com/ "Contrast Rebellion")&mdash;
which I understand has created a bit of controversy. 

I think the point espoused by Contrast Rebellion is both well-made and well-taken (despite the host of straw-man style arguments to the contrary); 
however, I feel that&mdash;in _most_ designs&mdash;contrast arises fairly organically. If I can't read my font, or there isn't 
enough contrast in my color palate, then I know that the people from whom I solicit opinions are going
to mention that before saying anything else.

If only we were all so lucky. &#9786;

On the [topic of color contrast](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CSS-TECHS/#style-color-contrast 'CSS Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0') the W3C defines [Success Criterion 1.4.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html 'Success Criterion 1.4.3') saying:
>**Contrast (Minimum)**: The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)
>* **Large Text**: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
>* **Incidental**: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
>* **Logotypes**: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

There is a formula for calculating the contrast of two colors available at [the paciello group](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html, 'Contrast Analyser')&mdash; they also have a Contrast Analyser that you can download for Mac and Windows.

Alternately, you could skip the download and the hand-cranking of numbers and enter your hex codes into the [Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analyser](http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php, 'Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analyser')

**Looking at popular websites contrast**

The genesis of this exercise was to review websites I have built and to review some other popular sites so lets do that &hellip;

<hr>

**The contrast on this site**

It's pretty good right? The text you're reading I mean&mdash;easy to read, contrast-wise anyway.

* **Text color**: [#444444](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/444444)
* **Background color**: [#f8f8f8](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/F8F8F8)
* **Contrast-ratio**: 9.17:1 
* **Analysis**: Pretty amazing.

<hr>

**Apple's nav bar**

Apple's nav bar is a gradient, so this analysis is for the color at the lightest point of the gradient versus the text

* **Text color**:  [#FFFFFF](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/FFFFFF)
* **Background color** (again, at the lightest part of the gradient): [#727272](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/727272)
* **Contrast-ratio**: 4.81:1
* **Analysis**: Passed at Level AA for regular text, and pass at Level AAA for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)&mdash;Apple's nav text is SVG (ostensibly for the new retina displays), but it seems to be about 13pt&ndash;14pt. A little low-contrast perhaps, but not too drastic.

**Google's account settings bar**

<img class="blogImg" src="/images/google-account-settings.png" alt="Google's account settings bar">

The Google account settings bar has always seemed to be fairly low-contrast to me&mdash;let's test a theory.

* **Text color**:  [#666666](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/666666)
* **Background color**: [#F1F1F1](http://www.colourlovers.com/color/F1F1F1)
* **Contrast-ratio**: 5.08:1
* **Analysis**: Passed at Level AA for regular text, and pass at Level AAA for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)&mdash;better contrast than Apple; however, the text in this image above is 13px/27px Arial,sans-serif at the default font-weight which is close, but not quite ideal.

Out of curiousity I decided to see what these recommendations would look like for Google in practice&mdash;answer: more readable, arguably less aesthetically appealing (see below).
