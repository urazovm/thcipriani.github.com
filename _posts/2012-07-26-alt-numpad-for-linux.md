title: Alt-Numpad for Linux
---

In Ubuntu the alt+numpad ACSII codes don’t work—this _was_ a major stumbling block for me since I am annoyingly [picky about typography](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/15/mind-your-en-and-em-dashes-typographic-etiquette/ "Smashing Magazine—mind your em and en dashes"). 

After spending way too much time Googling I found that these steps work:
* Hold Ctrl+Shift+U 
* Release the “U” key (while still holding Ctrl+Shift) 
* Type the Unicode code for the special character you’d like to use
* Find unicode characters by [searching on Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=em+dash "em dash - Wolfram|Alpha")

Of course, CopyPasteCharacter.com is another great [unicode character reference](http://copypastecharacter.com/ "✿ Our favorite set — CopyPasteCharacter.com")
